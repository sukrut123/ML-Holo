## ML-Holo
 This repository is created to make the accompanying Mathematica notebooks of https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08442 publicly available.
 
 
 There are four Mathematica files: \
 (1)generate-ini-conditions.m : Generates various initials conditions \
 (1)generate-raw-data.m : Generates raw dataset \
 (2)postprocess.m : Postprocesses raw dataset to create dataset that can be used to train and test a neural network \
 (3)do-ml.nb : Creates neural network, trains and tests it on the post-processed dataset \
 All the nbs are commented to help users easily follow the code. \
