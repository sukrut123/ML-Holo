# ML-Holo
# This repository is created to make the accompanying Mathematica notebooks of https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08442 publicly available.
# There are three mathematica nbs:
# (1)genrate-raw-data.nb : generates raw dataset 
# (2)postprocess.nb : Postprocesses raw dataset to create dataset that can be used to train and test a neural network
# (3)do-ml.nb : Creates neural network, trains and tests it on the postprocessed dataset
# All the nbs are commneted to help users easily follow the code
