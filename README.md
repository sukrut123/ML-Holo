# ML-Holo
# This repository is created to make the accompanying Mathematica notebooks of https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08442 publicly available.
# There are four Mathematica files:
# (1)generate-ini-conditions: Generates various initials conditions
# (1)generate-raw-data.m : Generates raw dataset 
# (2)postprocess.m : Postprocesses raw dataset to create dataset that can be used to train and test a neural network
# (3)do-ml.nb : Creates neural network, trains and tests it on the postprocessed dataset
# All the nbs are commented to help users easily follow the code.
